# coin_collect_game
Basic coin collector game.

This mini-game project's whole purpose was to learn object orianted programming and actually make a game to understand how it works.

I know the class' constructor site is ruined since it doesn't take any argumants.

I was just getting to know what OOP is by the time I started this game. 

And when I was done I actually realized how messed up the code was.
(It took me too long because I tried to add a feature for the player, a speed boost to be exact but I couldn't make it perfect so it's removed.) 

I will continue making game projects with Python.

It actually really is exciting because you understand the fundamantels of game developing and OOP.
